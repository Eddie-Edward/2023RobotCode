# Operator Controls

## Layers

Layers are similar to the shift key on your keyboard. When the shift key pressed the key performs a different action.
This is the shift layer of the keyboard. A similar concept can be achieved with controllers. If a button is bound to be
a modifier key (a la shift), other buttons / axis can then be mapped to different actions.
